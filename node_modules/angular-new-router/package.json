See the `examples/` directory in this repo for now.\n\n### Helping out\n\nFor now, the best way for you to help with the new router is to try it out and file GitHub issues\nwith questions or feedback. Please also [check out existing discussions](https://github.com/angular/router/labels/type%3A%20use%20case).\n\n## Goals\n\nThis router aims to fulfill the requirements mentioned in the [Angular 2.0 router design document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1I3UC0RrgCh9CKrLxeE4sxwmNSBl3oSXQGt9g3KZnTJI).\n\nBelow is a short summary of these goals:\n\n* Have sensible conventions and defaults\n* Be customizable at almost every point\n* Support sibling \"viewports\" (like `ng-view`s in Angular 1.x's ngRoute)\n* Support nested routers\n  * Allow components to encapsulate entire parts of an application\n* Expose a \"navigation model\" which can be used to generate a navigation UI (like menus)\n  * Expose which route in the model is active (useful in styling/highlighting links in the menu)\n* Generate `href`s based on router hierarchies\n* Lazy-load components\n* Be able to reuse component instances\n* Use either push state or hash change mode\n* Handle updating the document title\n\n\n## Prior Art\n\n* [Durandal Router](http://durandaljs.com/documentation/Using-The-Router.html)\n* [ngRoute from Angular 1.x](https://docs.angularjs.org/api/ngRoute)\n* [Route Recognizer](https://github.com/tildeio/route-recognizer)\n\n\n\n## License\nApache 2\n",
